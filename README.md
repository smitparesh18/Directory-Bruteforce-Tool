Directory Bruteforcing Tool

Bruteforcing directories is a technique used in cybersecurity to discover hidden or unlinked directories on a web server. 
It involves systematically trying a large number of possible directory names in order to find ones that may not be publicly 
advertised but are still accessible.

To Run it:
python3 brute.py -w wordlist.txt -u url
